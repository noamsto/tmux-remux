# tmux-state: Unified Persistence, Undo, and History Explorer

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Status:** Draft
**Primary repo:** `~/Data/git/noamsto/tmux-state` (new, to be created)
**Integrating repo:** `~/Data/git/lazytmux` (consumes `tmux-state` as a flake input)

**Supersedes:**
- `2026-04-19-undo-closed-windows-design.md` (close-event undo, bash, `/tmp` storage)
- `2026-04-26-session-persistence-design.md` (resurrect/continuum replacement, bash, tar.zst storage)
- `2026-04-19-undo-closed-windows.md` (implementation plan)

## Overview

A standalone Go binary, `tmux-state`, replaces `tmux-resurrect`, `tmux-continuum`, and the previously-spec'd `tmux-undo` feature. The binary lives in its own repository (`noamsto/tmux-state`) and is consumed by lazytmux as a flake input — same pattern as `worktrunk`. It speaks raw tmux protocol and ships zero lazytmux-specific knowledge; lazytmux supplies the keybindings, hook wiring, and home-manager options that integrate it.

It records tmux server activity to a SQLite event store with content-addressed scrollback files, exposing three complementary user-facing flows:

1. **Persistence** — periodic snapshots (every 60s + on structural-change hooks) restored automatically on tmux server start, through a smart filter that drops stale, idle, and duplicate entries.
2. **Undo** — close-event captures (`pane-died`, `window-unlinked`, `session-closed`) restored on demand via `prefix + u` (pop newest) or `prefix + U` (picker).
3. **Explore** — a Bubble Tea TUI (`prefix + E`) for browsing the full event history with manifest preview, scrollback peek, filter, and per-unit (session/window/pane) restore.

All three flows share one event store, one filter library, one set of tmux interaction primitives, and one binary.

## Repo Boundaries

| Concern | `tmux-state` repo | `lazytmux` repo |
|---|---|---|
| Go binary, SQLite store, scrollback CAS, restore engine | ✓ | — |
| Bubble Tea explorer TUI | ✓ | — |
| `tmux` shell-out wrapper, output parsers | ✓ | — |
| Smart filter (pure functions) | ✓ | — |
| Default config (allow-list, thresholds) | ✓ ships with sensible defaults | overrides via flake input args |
| `tmux.conf` `set-hook` lines, keybindings | — | ✓ in `config/tmux.conf.nix` |
| home-manager options block (`programs.lazytmux.persist`) | — | ✓ in `modules/home-manager.nix` |
| systemd user timer + service | — | ✓ written by home-manager from `programs.lazytmux.persist` options |
| Removal of `@resurrect-*` / `@continuum-*` lines | — | ✓ |

Other tmux users (not on lazytmux) consume `tmux-state` directly: `nix run github:noamsto/tmux-state -- save`, plus a small example tmux.conf snippet in the repo's README.

## Motivation

- **Resurrect/continuum are unmaintained, slow, and dumb on restore.** Forking a subprocess per pane during save (where one batched call would do), restoring stale sessions and idle splits unconditionally, and offering no integration with the rest of the tmux config. Auto-restore is so noisy that users (including us) keep `@continuum-restore 'off'`.
- **Undo and persistence share ~70% of their mechanics.** Both record session/window/pane structure with cwd, command, layout, and (optionally) scrollback. Both restore via tmux command sequences. Implementing them as two separate bash scripts would mean writing the same primitives twice, then refactoring to share them anyway.
- **Bash + SQLite is awkward.** Once SQLite enters the picture (necessary for shared event-store semantics, fast picker queries, clean pruning, and forward-compatible schema migrations), Go becomes the obvious implementation language: real prepared statements, typed manifests, parallel `tmux capture-pane`, table-driven tests. The lazytmux dev shell already pulls in `pkgs.go`/`gopls`/`gotools`.
- **Undo currently lives in `/tmp`** (per the prior spec). A unified durable store means undo also survives reboots — you can recover a pane closed yesterday after a host restart.

## Scope and Non-Goals

**In scope:**
- Single Go binary `tmux-state` with subcommands: `save`, `capture-event`, `index-update`, `restore`, `undo`, `pick`, `explore`, `list`, `prune`, `gc`, `version`.
- Periodic snapshot via systemd user timer + immediate snapshot on structural-change hooks.
- Close-event capture via `pane-died`, `window-unlinked`, `session-closed` hooks with "outermost wins" dedup.
- SQLite event store at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/lazytmux/state.db`.
- Content-addressed scrollback files at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/lazytmux/scrollbacks/<sha256>.zst` with refcount-based GC.
- Smart restore filter (dedup vs running server, stale-session age, idle-shell drop, idle-window drop, stale-snapshot age).
- Three restore modes: `auto`, `interactive`, `off`.
- Bubble Tea history explorer (`tmux-state explore`) with split-pane list + detail, filter mode, scrollback preview, per-unit restore.
- Keybindings: `prefix + u` (undo pop), `prefix + U` (undo picker), `prefix + R` (snapshot picker), `prefix + E` (history explorer TUI), `prefix + Ctrl-s` (save now).
- Allow-list-gated command re-launch on restore (`nvim`, `htop`, `lazygit`, …).
- Home-manager options for all thresholds and modes.
- Removal of `tmux-resurrect` / `tmux-continuum` plugin loads and configuration from `config/tmux.conf.nix`.
- Test suite via `go test ./...`, including parser tests, filter tests, scrollback dedup/refcount tests, and an integration test that drives a real tmux server.

**Out of scope:**
- nvim/vim per-buffer session restoration (requires nvim-side `mksession` cooperation; future spec).
- Cross-host snapshot portability (cwds are absolute paths). Syncthing on the data dir is the user-level workaround, not a feature.
- Migration from existing `~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/` saves. Different schema, stale within a week anyway.
- Cloud sync / remote SQLite. Wrong threat model — tmux scrollback contains paths and pasted secrets.
- Restoring arbitrary running processes. Re-launch is best-effort against the configured allow-list.
- Backwards compatibility with the prior bash-based tmux-undo design. Nothing was implemented.

### Component Responsibilities

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cmd/tmux-state/main.go` | CLI entry. Subcommand dispatch, flag parsing. |
| `internal/store` | SQLite access. Migrations, prepared statements, transactions. |
| `internal/snapshot` | Read live tmux server, build a manifest, persist as a `snapshot` event. |
| `internal/closeevent` | Handle pane/window/session close hooks with cascade dedup. |
| `internal/restore` | Read events, apply filter, plan tmux commands, execute. |
| `internal/filter` | Smart-filter predicates (dedup, idle, stale). Pure functions, easy to test. |
| `internal/scrollback` | Content-addressed compressed scrollback files. Hash, refcount, GC. |
| `internal/tmux` | Wraps `exec.Command("tmux", ...)`. Output parsing, safe argument passing. |
| `internal/picker` | `fzf` invocation and result formatting for fast undo/snapshot pickers. |
| `internal/explore` | Bubble Tea TUI for the `explore` subcommand: split-pane history browser with manifest detail and scrollback preview. |
| `internal/config` | Config loading (env vars, CLI flags). |
| `internal/log` | Structured logging via `log/slog`. |

### Single-Writer Discipline

All write paths acquire a process-level `flock` on `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/lazytmux/write.lock` before opening the DB. SQLite is configured with WAL mode (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`) for non-blocking reads while a write is in progress. Every write transaction uses `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` to avoid deadlocks under contention. Reads (e.g., during a picker session) do not require the lock.

The flock is *additional* protection on top of SQLite's own locking — it serializes operations that span multiple SQL statements and filesystem changes (e.g., scrollback file writes + DB inserts must succeed together).

## Storage Layout

```
$XDG_DATA_HOME/lazytmux/
  state.db                         — SQLite database
  state.db-wal                     — WAL file (auto-managed)
  state.db-shm                     — shared memory file (auto-managed)
  scrollbacks/
    <sha256[:2]>/<sha256>.zst     — sharded by first byte for filesystem sanity
  log                              — best-effort log, rotated at 1MB

$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/lazytmux/         — transient, cleared on reboot
  write.lock                       — flock(1) advisory lock
  restore-<pid>/                   — temp dir for in-flight restore
```

Sharding scrollbacks by `<sha256[:2]>` (first 2 hex chars = 256 buckets) keeps any single directory bounded even with thousands of unique scrollbacks accumulated over months.

## Database Schema

Schema versioned via `PRAGMA user_version`. Migrations applied at startup if `user_version < latest`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id              INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    ts              INTEGER NOT NULL,                -- ms epoch
    kind            TEXT    NOT NULL,                -- 'snapshot' | 'pane-died' | 'window-unlinked' | 'session-closed'
    scope           TEXT    NOT NULL,                -- 'server' | 'session' | 'window' | 'pane'
    reason          TEXT,                            -- e.g. 'timer', 'hook:session-created', 'keybinding'
    host            TEXT    NOT NULL,                -- hostname; helps if user ever syncs
    parent_event_id INTEGER REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    manifest_json   TEXT    NOT NULL                 -- JSON; full session/window/pane tree
) STRICT;

CREATE INDEX events_kind_ts ON events(kind, ts DESC);
CREATE INDEX events_ts      ON events(ts DESC);

CREATE TABLE scrollbacks (
    sha256        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                  -- 64 hex chars
    bytes         INTEGER NOT NULL,                  -- compressed size on disk
    refcount      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    last_used_ts  INTEGER NOT NULL                   -- updated on insert + ref
) STRICT;

CREATE TABLE event_scrollbacks (
    event_id        INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    pane_key        TEXT    NOT NULL,                -- '<session>:<window_idx>:<pane_idx>'
    scrollback_sha  TEXT    NOT NULL REFERENCES scrollbacks(sha256),
    PRIMARY KEY (event_id, pane_key)
) STRICT;

CREATE INDEX event_scrollbacks_sha ON event_scrollbacks(scrollback_sha);

CREATE TABLE meta (
    key   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value TEXT NOT NULL
) STRICT;
-- meta keys: schema_version, last_save_fingerprint, last_save_ts
```

### Manifest JSON

Stored as `events.manifest_json`. Per-event content depends on `kind`:

**`kind = 'snapshot'`** — full server state.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "host": "thinkpad-p14s-g6",
  "tmux_pid": 12345,
  "saved_at": 1745700000,
  "sessions": [
    {
      "name": "lazytmux",
      "last_attached": 1745699940,
      "windows": [
        {
          "index": 1,
          "name": "main",
          "layout": "abcd,200x50,0,0,1",
          "panes": [
            {
              "index": 1,
              "cwd": "/home/noams/Data/git/lazytmux",
              "command": "nvim",
              "command_args": ["scripts/tmux-state-store.go"],
              "last_used": 1745699940,
              "child_count": 2,
              "scrollback_sha": "abc123..."
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**`kind = 'pane-died' | 'window-unlinked' | 'session-closed'`** — only the dying unit's state.

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "host": "...",
  "session": {
    "name": "lazytmux",
    "windows": [
      { /* only the affected window or windows, with affected pane(s) */ }
    ]
  },
  "split_direction": "h"   // pane-died only; relative to surviving sibling, or "none"
}
```

Tolerant restore: unknown fields ignored; `v` mismatch logs a warning and skips the event.

### Cascade Dedup for Close Events

When `Ctrl+D` in the last pane of the last window of a session cascades, all three hooks fire in order. Dedup rules (mirroring the prior undo spec, but expressed as DB queries):

1. **`session-closed`** writes a session-level event row, with `manifest_json` containing all of that session's windows/panes assembled from a shadow index updated on structural-change hooks.
2. **`window-unlinked`** checks for a fresh (`ts > now() - 2000` ms) `session-closed` event whose manifest references this window's `session_id`. If present, skip.
3. **`pane-died`** checks for a fresh `session-closed` or `window-unlinked` event whose manifest references this pane's parent. If present, skip.

The shadow index lives in a small in-memory cache that the `capture-event` subcommand updates from a sidecar table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE live_index (
    session_id  TEXT NOT NULL,                       -- tmux $N
    payload     TEXT NOT NULL,                       -- JSON: windows, panes, layouts, cwds
    updated_at  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (session_id)
) STRICT;
```

Refreshed on `window-linked`, `window-unlinked`, `window-renamed`, `window-layout-changed`, `pane-died` (before the dying pane disappears from `list-panes`). Cleared for closed sessions after capture.

This shifts cost from "query at close time" to "record incrementally," matching the existing `/tmp/claude-status/panes/*` pattern in lazytmux.

## Save Logic (Periodic Snapshots)

### Trigger Sources

| Source | Mechanism | Throttle |
|---|---|---|
| Periodic | systemd user timer (`OnUnitActiveSec=60s`, `OnBootSec=2min`) → `tmux-state save --reason=timer` | none — timer drives baseline |
| Structural change | tmux hooks: `session-created`, `window-linked`, `client-detached` → `run-shell -b "tmux-state save --reason=hook:<name>"` | `min_save_interval` (default 30s) |
| Manual | `prefix + Ctrl-s` → `tmux-state save --reason=keybinding` | bypasses throttle |

The systemd timer drives the baseline; hooks accelerate save *toward* a baseline it would have eventually reached. Throttling is by `last_save_ts` in the `meta` table.

### Save Algorithm

1. Acquire `flock` on `write.lock`. If held: exit 0.
2. Read `last_save_ts` and `last_save_fingerprint` from `meta`.
3. Read live server: 3 batched `tmux` calls (`list-sessions -F`, `list-windows -a -F`, `list-panes -a -F`). Parse into `Manifest{Sessions[]}`.
4. Compute `fingerprint` = sha256 of canonical manifest with timestamps zeroed.
5. If `fingerprint == last_save_fingerprint` AND throttle applies AND `--reason != keybinding`: exit 0.
6. **Parallel scrollback capture** — goroutine pool of N workers (default `runtime.NumCPU()`), each running `tmux capture-pane -pJ -t <pane> -S -`. For each pane: hash content, write `scrollbacks/<sha[:2]>/<sha>.zst` if not present (insert into `scrollbacks` table with `refcount=0` if new), record sha in manifest.
7. Open SQLite tx (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`):
   - Insert `events` row with `kind='snapshot'`, `manifest_json`.
   - For each pane scrollback: insert `event_scrollbacks` row + `UPDATE scrollbacks SET refcount = refcount + 1, last_used_ts = ? WHERE sha256 = ?`.
   - Update `meta` `last_save_ts`, `last_save_fingerprint`.
   - Commit.
8. Release flock.

Errors at step 7 leave orphan scrollback files (uploaded but not referenced); a periodic `gc` subcommand reaps these (see GC section).

### Pruning

After every save (post-commit), delete events older than the configured retention:

```sql
DELETE FROM events
WHERE kind = 'snapshot'
  AND id NOT IN (
      SELECT id FROM events
      WHERE kind = 'snapshot'
      ORDER BY ts DESC
      LIMIT ?      -- snapshot_history_limit (default 20)
  );

DELETE FROM events
WHERE kind != 'snapshot'
  AND id NOT IN (
      SELECT id FROM events
      WHERE kind != 'snapshot'
      ORDER BY ts DESC
      LIMIT ?      -- close_event_limit (default 50)
  );
```

`event_scrollbacks` rows cascade-delete via FK. Decrement `refcount` is handled by an `AFTER DELETE` trigger on `event_scrollbacks`:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER decrement_scrollback_refcount
AFTER DELETE ON event_scrollbacks
BEGIN
    UPDATE scrollbacks
    SET refcount = refcount - 1
    WHERE sha256 = OLD.scrollback_sha;
END;
```

The orphaned scrollback files (refcount = 0) are reaped by `gc` (see below).

## Capture Logic (Close Events)

Hooks wired in `config/tmux.conf.nix`:

```tmux
set-hook -g pane-died          'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} capture-event pane-died          --pane=#{hook_pane} --window=#{hook_window} --session=#{hook_session}"'
set-hook -g window-unlinked    'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} capture-event window-unlinked    --window=#{hook_window} --session=#{hook_session}"'
set-hook -g session-closed     'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} capture-event session-closed     --session=#{hook_session}"'

# live index maintenance
set-hook -g window-linked         'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} index-update --session=#{hook_session}"'
set-hook -g window-renamed        'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} index-update --session=#{hook_session}"'
set-hook -g window-layout-changed 'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} index-update --session=#{hook_session}"'
```

`capture-event` reads from `live_index` (since the unit is gone or going), assembles a manifest, applies cascade dedup, and inserts an event row. No scrollback capture for close events — the pane process is dead, and `tmux capture-pane` against a missing pane fails. (We could capture scrollback eagerly in `index-update`, but every-event scrollback writes are too expensive for marginal value. Persistence covers the "I want my scrollback back" use case.)

## Restore Logic

### Auto-Restore on tmux Start

`config/tmux.conf.nix` adds, after all session/window setup:

```tmux
run-shell -b '${tmux-state-bin} restore --auto'
```

`restore --auto` behavior:
1. If `restore_mode == "off"`: exit 0.
2. Read most recent `kind='snapshot'` event.
3. If `now - event.ts > restore_max_snapshot_age`: log "snapshot too old, skipping" and exit 0.
4. Apply smart filter to manifest. Produce a restore plan.
5. Execute plan via `tmux` commands (see "Restore Plan Execution" below).

### `prefix + u` (Undo Pop)

`tmux-state undo --pop`:
1. Read most recent close event (`kind != 'snapshot'`).
2. Restore its manifest unconditionally (no smart filter — user explicitly asked).
3. Delete the event row on success.
4. `switch-client` / `select-window` / `select-pane` to the restored unit.

### `prefix + U` (Undo Picker) and `prefix + R` (Snapshot Picker)

Both run `tmux-state pick --kind=<close|snapshot>`, which opens a `display-popup` running `fzf` over event rows. Each row is rendered with `id`, `ts` (humanized), summary (e.g., `"session 'lazytmux' (3 windows, 7 panes)"`).

For snapshots, the smart filter is applied and the result is shown as a checklist (toggleable per session/window/pane). For close events, the user just selects an event to restore — no filter.

### `prefix + E` (History Explorer TUI)

`tmux-state explore` — opens a Bubble Tea TUI in `display-popup -E -w 90% -h 80%`. Designed for *browsing* history rather than restoring one specific thing fast.

**Components (Bubble Tea models):**

- **Event list** (left) — sorted by `ts DESC`. Filterable by kind, time range, session name. Supports `/` for incremental search across all visible columns.
- **Detail pane** (right) — top: event metadata (kind, ts, reason, host, parent_event_id). Middle: collapsible tree of session/window/pane structure parsed from `manifest_json`. Bottom: optional scrollback preview (last N lines of zstd-decompressed file).
- **Status bar** — keybinding hints, current filter expression, total/visible event counts.

**Keybindings:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j`/`k` or `↓`/`↑` | Move selection |
| `g`/`G` | Top / bottom |
| `enter` | Restore the highlighted unit (whole event, OR selected sub-tree node if cursor is on a pane/window) |
| `space` | Toggle expansion of session/window node in detail tree |
| `s` | Toggle scrollback preview for the highlighted pane |
| `/` | Filter mode (incremental) |
| `f` | Cycle filter: all / snapshots only / close events only |
| `d` | Delete highlighted event (with confirmation) |
| `r` | Refresh (re-query DB) |
| `?` | Help overlay |
| `q` / `esc` | Quit |

**Per-unit restore semantics:**

When the cursor is on a sub-tree node (session/window/pane within a snapshot), `enter` restores *only* that unit, not the whole event. Internally this builds a one-element restore plan.

For a pane node: same as `prefix + u` would do for that single pane.
For a window node: re-create the window with all its panes.
For a session node: re-create the session with all its windows.
For an event-level row: re-create everything in that event (modulo dedup).

**Scrollback preview:**

Reads `event_scrollbacks.scrollback_sha`, decompresses the file, displays the last 20 lines (`tail -n 20`-equivalent in Go) inline. Toggle with `s` to expand to last 200 lines. Avoids loading huge scrollbacks into memory at once via streaming zstd decode.

**Implementation notes:**

- `internal/explore` package owns the TUI. Uses `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea` + `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss` + `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles/list` for the left pane.
- Read-only against the DB by default. Delete action acquires the write flock.
- Updates are reactive: a periodic `tea.Tick` re-queries event count; if changed, prompts user with "new events available, press `r` to refresh." Avoids surprise mutations under the cursor.
- Tested via Bubble Tea's `teatest` harness for golden-output assertions on the rendered frames.

### Smart Filter

Configurable thresholds (defaults shown). All applied at restore time, not save time:

| Filter | Default | Applies to | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dedup_running_server` | true | session | Skip if a session with that name already exists. |
| `restore_max_session_age` | 14d | session | Skip if `now - last_attached > threshold`. |
| `restore_max_snapshot_age` | 30d | snapshot | Skip whole snapshot if older. |
| `restore_skip_idle_shells` | true | pane | Skip pane if `command ∈ {bash,fish,zsh,sh}` AND `child_count == 0`. |
| `restore_skip_idle_windows` | true | window | Skip window if every pane filtered out. |

### Restore Plan Execution

Plan is a slice of typed actions:

```go
type Action interface{ Execute(*tmux.Client) error }
type CreateSession struct{ Name, Cwd string }
type CreateWindow struct{ Session, Name string; Index int; Cwd string }
type SplitPane struct{ Target, Cwd string }
type SetLayout struct{ Window, Layout string }
type RelaunchCommand struct{ Pane, Command string; Args []string }
type RestoreScrollback struct{ Pane, Sha256 string }
```

Executed in dependency order. Errors logged but do not abort the rest of the plan — we always make best effort to restore as much as possible.

`RestoreScrollback` writes the decompressed scrollback to a tmux buffer (`load-buffer`) and pastes it into the pane (`paste-buffer -t <pane>`). The pasted content shows up in copy mode (`prefix + [`), matching resurrect's behavior. The shell prompt shows below the restored history.

## Command Allow-List

```go
var DefaultAllowList = []string{
    "nvim", "vim", "vi",
    "htop", "btop", "top",
    "less", "more", "tail", "head", "watch",
    "lazygit", "lazydocker",
    "k9s", "kubectl",
    "ssh", "mosh",
}
```

Configurable via home-manager `programs.lazytmux.persist.commandAllowList`. Anything not on the list restores as a fresh shell in the saved cwd.

## GC (Scrollback Cleanup)

Subcommand `tmux-state gc`. Run weekly via systemd timer.

1. Acquire flock.
2. `SELECT sha256, bytes FROM scrollbacks WHERE refcount <= 0`.
3. For each sha: `unlink` the file at `scrollbacks/<sha[:2]>/<sha>.zst`, then `DELETE FROM scrollbacks WHERE sha256 = ?`.
4. As a safety net: walk `scrollbacks/` directory; for any file *not* present in the `scrollbacks` table, delete it. (Catches files orphaned by mid-write crashes.)
5. `VACUUM` if DB size > 50MB.
6. Release flock.

## Configuration

### Home-Manager Options (`programs.lazytmux.persist`)

```nix
{
  enable = mkEnableOption "tmux state store" // { default = true; };

  # Save behavior
  saveInterval        = mkOption { type = types.int;  default = 60; };
  minSaveInterval     = mkOption { type = types.int;  default = 30; };
  snapshotHistoryLimit = mkOption { type = types.int; default = 20; };
  closeEventLimit     = mkOption { type = types.int;  default = 50; };
  captureScrollback   = mkOption { type = types.bool; default = true; };

  # Restore behavior
  restoreMode = mkOption { type = types.enum [ "auto" "interactive" "off" ]; default = "auto"; };
  restoreMaxSessionAge   = mkOption { type = types.int;  default = 14 * 24 * 3600; };
  restoreMaxSnapshotAge  = mkOption { type = types.int;  default = 30 * 24 * 3600; };
  restoreSkipIdleShells  = mkOption { type = types.bool; default = true; };
  restoreSkipIdleWindows = mkOption { type = types.bool; default = true; };
  dedupRunningServer     = mkOption { type = types.bool; default = true; };

  # Allow-list
  commandAllowList = mkOption {
    type = types.listOf types.str;
    default = [ "nvim" "vim" "vi" "htop" "btop" "top" "less" "more" "tail" "head" "watch" "lazygit" "lazydocker" "k9s" "kubectl" "ssh" "mosh" ];
  };

  # GC
  gcInterval = mkOption { type = types.str; default = "weekly"; };
}
```

### Per-Pane Tmux User Options

- `set -p @persist-skip on` — exclude pane from snapshots and close-event captures.
- `set -p @persist-skip-scrollback on` — capture metadata only, no scrollback bytes for this pane.

### CLI Flags

All home-manager options are mirrored as CLI flags on `tmux-state` for ad-hoc use. The systemd unit reads from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/lazytmux/state.toml` (generated by home-manager) for default values; CLI flags override.

## Tmux Integration

### config/tmux.conf.nix Changes

**Remove:**

```tmux
set -g @resurrect-strategy-vim 'session'
set -g @resurrect-strategy-nvim 'session'
set -g @resurrect-capture-pane-contents 'on'
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'
set -g @continuum-save-interval '10'
```

```tmux
run-shell ${tmuxPlugins.resurrect}/share/tmux-plugins/resurrect/resurrect.tmux
run-shell ${tmuxPlugins.continuum}/share/tmux-plugins/continuum/continuum.tmux
```

```
#(${tmuxPlugins.continuum}/share/tmux-plugins/continuum/scripts/continuum_save.sh)
```

(in `status-format[0]`).

**Add:**

```tmux
# tmux-state hooks (set-hook is replace-by-name on reload, no stacking)
set-hook -g session-created       'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} save --reason=hook:session-created"'
set-hook -g window-linked         'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} save --reason=hook:window-linked"'
set-hook -g client-detached       'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} save --reason=hook:client-detached"'

set-hook -g pane-died             'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} capture-event pane-died          --pane=#{hook_pane} --window=#{hook_window} --session=#{hook_session}"'
set-hook -g window-unlinked       'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} capture-event window-unlinked    --window=#{hook_window} --session=#{hook_session}"'
set-hook -g session-closed        'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} capture-event session-closed     --session=#{hook_session}"'

set-hook -g window-renamed        'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} index-update --session=#{hook_session}"'
set-hook -g window-layout-changed 'run-shell -b "${tmux-state-bin} index-update --session=#{hook_session}"'

# Auto-restore (runs once at config load)
run-shell -b '${tmux-state-bin} restore --auto'

# Keybindings
bind   u    run-shell '${tmux-state-bin} undo --pop'
bind   U    run-shell '${tmux-state-bin} pick --kind=close'
bind   R    run-shell '${tmux-state-bin} pick --kind=snapshot'
bind   E    display-popup -E -w 90% -h 80% '${tmux-state-bin} explore'
bind C-s    run-shell '${tmux-state-bin} save --reason=keybinding'
```

### config/tmux.conf.nix Substitution

Add to the `scripts` attrset alongside existing entries:

```nix
tmux-state = pkgs.callPackage ../packages/tmux-state.nix { };
```

(Or inline `buildGoModule { ... }` if you prefer not to introduce a `packages/` directory. The wt-go-rewrite spec uses an external repo; for `tmux-state` we keep the source in-tree.)

### modules/home-manager.nix Changes

Update the comment at line 316 (`tmux-continuum's auto-restore` → `lazytmux state-store auto-restore`).

Add systemd units:

```nix
systemd.user.timers.lazytmux-state-save = {
  Unit.Description = "Periodic tmux state snapshot";
  Timer = {
    OnBootSec = "2min";
    OnUnitActiveSec = "${toString cfg.persist.saveInterval}s";
    Unit = "lazytmux-state-save.service";
  };
  Install.WantedBy = [ "timers.target" ];
};

systemd.user.services.lazytmux-state-save = {
  Unit.Description = "Save tmux state";
  Service = {
    Type = "oneshot";
    ExecStart = "${tmux-state-bin} save --reason=timer";
  };
};

systemd.user.timers.lazytmux-state-gc = {
  Unit.Description = "tmux state store GC";
  Timer = {
    OnCalendar = cfg.persist.gcInterval;     # default "weekly"
    Unit = "lazytmux-state-gc.service";
  };
  Install.WantedBy = [ "timers.target" ];
};

systemd.user.services.lazytmux-state-gc = {
  Unit.Description = "tmux state store garbage collection";
  Service = {
    Type = "oneshot";
    ExecStart = "${tmux-state-bin} gc";
  };
};
```

## Implementation: Go Module

The Go source lives at the **root** of the new `tmux-state` repo (not inside lazytmux).

### Dependencies

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `modernc.org/sqlite` | Pure-Go SQLite (no CGO; clean Nix build, cross-compiles trivially) |
| `github.com/spf13/cobra` | CLI framework — used in `worktrunk` precedent |
| `github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd` | Pure-Go zstd for scrollback compression |
| `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea` | TUI framework for the `explore` subcommand |
| `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles` | List/viewport/textinput components |
| `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss` | TUI styling |
| `github.com/charmbracelet/x/exp/teatest` | Golden-frame tests for the TUI |
| `github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp` | Test diffing |
| Standard library | `encoding/json`, `crypto/sha256`, `log/slog`, `os/exec`, `sync`, `context` |

`modernc.org/sqlite` over `mattn/go-sqlite3` because:
- No CGO → trivially cross-compiles in Nix's `buildGoModule`
- No system libsqlite3 dep
- Performance gap vs. CGO version is ~10-20% on inserts; immaterial for our QPS

### Nix Packaging

In the **`tmux-state` repo's** `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  description = "Fast, smart tmux state persistence — replaces resurrect/continuum.";

  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  inputs.flake-parts.url = "github:hercules-ci/flake-parts";

  outputs = inputs @ { flake-parts, ... }:
    flake-parts.lib.mkFlake { inherit inputs; } {
      systems = [ "x86_64-linux" "aarch64-linux" "x86_64-darwin" "aarch64-darwin" ];
      perSystem = { pkgs, ... }: {
        packages.default = pkgs.buildGoModule {
          pname = "tmux-state";
          version = "0.1.0";
          src = ./.;
          vendorHash = "sha256-...";       # filled in at build time
          subPackages = [ "cmd/tmux-state" ];
          doCheck = true;                  # runs go test ./...
          meta.mainProgram = "tmux-state";
        };
        apps.default.program = "${self.packages.${system}.default}/bin/tmux-state";
      };
    };
}
```

In the **`lazytmux` repo's** `flake.nix`:

```nix
inputs.tmux-state.url = "github:noamsto/tmux-state";
inputs.tmux-state.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
```

And in `config/tmux.conf.nix`, accept it as an arg:

```nix
{ pkgs, lib, tmux-state, ... }:
# ...
let
  tmux-state-bin = "${tmux-state.packages.${pkgs.system}.default}/bin/tmux-state";
in
# referenced as ${tmux-state-bin} in hooks and keybindings, same store-path interpolation pattern as scripts
```

### Go Coding Conventions

- `golangci-lint` enabled in pre-commit (already in lazytmux pre-commit infra).
- `errcheck`, `govet`, `staticcheck`, `revive`, `gosec` all on.
- Errors wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`. No `errors.New` for production paths — every error has context.
- Logging: `log/slog` with JSON handler in production, text in development. All log entries include `subcommand`, `event_id` (where applicable), `pane_key` (where applicable).
- Tests use table-driven style. Integration test guarded by `if testing.Short() { t.Skip(...) }`.
- No `init()` side effects. Everything is constructed explicitly in `main`.
- Context propagation: every blocking call accepts `context.Context`. The CLI builds a single root `context.Background()` with signal cancellation at startup.

## Survival Across Nix Rebuilds

- **systemd units** — home-manager regenerates unit files into `~/.config/systemd/user/`, runs `systemctl --user daemon-reload`, and the new unit points at the new `/nix/store/.../tmux-state` binary. In-flight `oneshot` save services killed mid-rebuild lose at most one timer tick (~60s).
- **tmux hooks** — bound to old store path until `tmux source-file` runs in the activation script (already present in `modules/home-manager.nix`). `set-hook -g` replaces by name on reload, no stacking. Old binary still on disk (its generation isn't GC'd), so old hooks keep working in the gap.
- **Database & scrollbacks** — under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/lazytmux/`, outside `/nix/store`. Survive rebuilds, generation rollbacks, `nix-collect-garbage`.
- **Schema drift** — `PRAGMA user_version` checked at every DB open. If `current > expected`, log "newer DB schema, refusing to run" and exit non-zero (forward-incompat = explicit). If `current < expected`, run migrations from `internal/store/migrations/` in order.
- **Generation rollback** — older binary opens DB; if migration was forward-only (e.g., new column), older code reads from a wider table without harm. We commit to migrations being **backward compatible at the SQL level for one minor version** so rollback works for at least one step.
- **Hook duplication on reload** — `set-hook -g <name>` replaces the named hook; no stacking. (This is one of the reasons we prefer the systemd timer over an in-tmux background loop.)

## Testing

All Go tests run inside the `tmux-state` repo (`go test ./...`). The lazytmux side has no Go code; lazytmux validation is `nix flake check` + the manual checklist below.

### Unit Tests (`go test ./...` in tmux-state)

Per-package tests for:
- `internal/snapshot/parse_test.go` — table-driven on canned `tmux list-panes -F '...'` output strings, including weird cases (newlines in commands, unicode in window names, empty cwd).
- `internal/filter/filter_test.go` — every filter rule, every threshold edge case.
- `internal/restore/plan_test.go` — given a manifest, assert action sequence.
- `internal/scrollback/store_test.go` — write same content twice → one file; refcount + GC.
- `internal/store/store_test.go` — open, migrate, insert, query, prune; uses `:memory:` SQLite.
- `internal/explore/explore_test.go` — `teatest` golden-frame tests for navigation, filter mode, sub-tree expansion, scrollback preview toggle.

### Integration Test (`go test -run TestIntegration` in tmux-state)

A single end-to-end test in `integration_test.go`:
1. Start a fresh tmux server on a tmp socket.
2. Create 2 sessions × 3 windows × 2 panes; populate cwds and run a few commands.
3. Run `tmux-state save`.
4. Kill the server.
5. Start a new server on the same socket.
6. Run `tmux-state restore --auto`.
7. Assert: server now has the same session/window/pane structure, cwds preserved, allow-listed commands re-launched.

Skipped under `go test -short`. Wrapped with `t.TempDir()` + `defer cleanup`.

### Manual Verification Checklist

(Same as the superseded specs, plus close-event paths.)

1. Save roundtrip with `nvim` + plain shell + `htop`.
2. Idle-shell filter drops bare bash with no children, keeps `nvim`.
3. Dedup against running server: restore twice, no duplication.
4. Stale session: edit `last_attached` to >14d, verify skip.
5. Stale snapshot: edit `saved_at` to >30d, verify whole snapshot skipped.
6. Scrollback restore visible in copy mode (`prefix + [`).
7. `prefix + u` after `Ctrl+D` in last pane of a window restores the pane.
8. `prefix + u` after closing a session restores the whole session.
9. `prefix + U` shows close-event picker; selecting an entry restores it.
10. `prefix + R` shows snapshot picker with smart-filter pre-applied.
11. `prefix + Ctrl-s` triggers an immediate save; verify new event row.
12. `prefix + E` opens the explore TUI; navigation (`j/k`, `g/G`) works; events list matches DB.
13. Explore TUI filter mode (`/`) narrows the list incrementally; `f` cycles kind filter.
14. Explore TUI per-unit restore: place cursor on a pane node inside an event, press `enter`, verify only that pane is restored.
15. Explore TUI scrollback preview: `s` shows last 20 lines for highlighted pane; toggle to expand to 200.
16. Explore TUI delete (`d`): event row removed, scrollback files reaped on next `gc`.
17. Save throttling: open 10 windows in quick succession, verify ≤ ceil(elapsed/30) snapshot rows.
18. GC: manually delete event rows, run `tmux-state gc`, verify scrollback files reaped.
19. Rebuild survival: `home-manager switch`, verify timer + hooks still functional.
20. Generation rollback: `home-manager switch --rollback`, verify older binary operates on existing DB or fails cleanly.
21. `nix flake check` (lazytmux side) and `go test ./... && go vet ./... && golangci-lint run` (tmux-state side) both pass.

## Migration & Rollout

Two-repo bootstrap, then one wiring PR:

1. **Phase 1 — `tmux-state` repo bootstrap.**
   - Create `github.com/noamsto/tmux-state` (empty repo).
   - Initial commit: `flake.nix`, `go.mod`, `cmd/tmux-state/main.go` skeleton, `internal/log`, `internal/store` with migration 0001, README, examples/tmux.conf.
   - Subsequent PRs: build out each `internal/` package per the layout above. Tests gate every PR.
   - Release v0.1.0 once `save`, `restore --auto`, `undo --pop`, and `pick` work end-to-end (explore can ship in v0.2.0).

2. **Phase 2 — `lazytmux` integration PR.**
   - Add `tmux-state` flake input.
   - Update `config/tmux.conf.nix`: hook wiring, keybindings, removal of `@resurrect-*` / `@continuum-*` lines and the `continuum_save.sh` invocation.
   - Update `modules/home-manager.nix`: new `programs.lazytmux.persist` options block, systemd timer + service, GC timer.
   - Update CLAUDE.md to mention `tmux-state` as the persistence layer.

3. **Phase 3 — explore (optional, after v0.1.0).** Add the Bubble Tea TUI, `prefix + E` binding, `tmux-state explore` subcommand.

Existing `~/.local/share/tmux/resurrect/` saves are NOT read. Documented in the lazytmux PR release note. User can manually delete the directory if desired.

User-facing rollout: `home-manager switch`; activation script reloads tmux config; first save runs ~2 min after timer fires.

## Future Work (Not In This Spec)

- nvim cooperation: companion Lua module that writes `mksession` files on `VimLeave`; `tmux-state` invokes it on save and restores via `nvim -S` on relaunch.
- Per-session restore-mode override: `set -t <session> @persist-mode interactive` to override the global `restoreMode`.
- Cross-host snapshot portability via cwd remap rules (`/home/old/path` → `/home/new/path` substitution at restore time).
- Snapshot diff/compaction: store snapshot N as a delta from snapshot N-1 to reduce DB size for users with very stable layouts.
- FTS5 over the `scrollbacks` table for full-text search of pane scrollback contents from the `explore` TUI.
- Web UI for browsing history (separate frontend over the same SQLite store).
- Auto-publish `tmux-state` to nixpkgs once stable.
